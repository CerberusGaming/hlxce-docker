# HLstatsX:CE

A [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/crinis/hlxce/) for running HLstatsX:CE in a Docker container.

> I do not recommend using this image anymore as the original project HLstatsX:CE has not been updated for years. I have no influence on that. Consider this project deprecated.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you to get a containerized installation of HLstatsX 1.6.19 running. This includes a web interface, a database with phpmyadmin and a HLstatsX: CE daemon. I recommend to use fixed tags of my Docker images as the latest tag is subject to change.

### Prerequisites
You need a working installation of Docker and Docker compose to follow the installation instructions.

[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

[Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installing
For a basic setup use my pre-configured [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml). Make sure to change all passwords before running this in production.

Run the following command in the same folder as the docker-compose.yml file to get the containers running. 
If you run this container for the first time or want to update the database, make sure to add UPDATE_DB: 'true' to the environment variables of the "web" service. When you are done remove it and restart the service. This will also remove the updater/ and sql/ directories.
```
docker-compose up
```
Now you should have your HLstatsX: CE web interface running at port 80, the Perl daemon at port 27500 and an instance of phpMyAdmin at port 8080.


Now add the following commands to the server.cfg file of your gameserver.
```
log on
logaddress_add ip_of_your_host_running_this_image:27500
```
Install the appropriate [HLstatsX: CE repository](https://bitbucket.org/Maverick_of_UC/hlstatsx-community-edition/) plugins working for your type of gameserver.

## Limitations
In a future update you might have to update the database yourself.

In case you decide to mount the /var/www/html/ directory as a volume you have to update HLstatsX manually too.

## Versioning
I use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/crinis/hlxce-docker/tags).
